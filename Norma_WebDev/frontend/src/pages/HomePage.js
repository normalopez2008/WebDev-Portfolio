                    The six major specifications of images for the web are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Descriptive file name:</strong> this is used to improve search
                            engine optimization so search engines can easily sort through files when users
                            are searching for related images. The files names should be brief but descriptive
                            such as a boy holding a baseball bat should be named: boy-baseball-bat.jpg.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Small file size:</strong> this is used to serve high resolution images
                            to high resolution devices by reducing the file size to as small as possible for
                            the fastest load time.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Exact dimensions:</strong> this is used to crop and reduce the size of images.
                            In order for an image to load quickly it needs to fit the dimensions of the webpage.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Correct file format:</strong> images are supposed to be in correct file format
                            such as <strong>JPG</strong> which is most appropriate for online photos, 
                            <strong>.GIF or 8-bit .PNG</strong> which is most appropriate line-art suchs as logos, icons.
                            <strong>24-bit .PNG</strong> is used for graphics with true transparenncy.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Reduced resolution:</strong> this is required to render images on specific monitors
                            and ranges from 72 to 300+ pixels per inch.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Color mode:</strong> uses <strong>RGB</strong> for .PNG, .JPG, .SVG, and .WebP, 
                            and <strong>Indexed</strong> for .GIF.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
